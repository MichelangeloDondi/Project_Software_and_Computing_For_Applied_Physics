This program assumes that the users have electrical circuits drawn on paper and its aim is to allow the users to re-draw their circuits as virtual images.

This program is primarily intended for users who wish to create circuit images for presentations and publications. Additionally, it can benefit those engaged in circuit design.

The development of this project initially started in the Julia language. However, it was transitioned to Python due to complications encountered when packaging from Julia.
